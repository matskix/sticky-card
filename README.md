🗒️ Sticky Card
Version: 1.0
Sticky Card began with a simple idea — to reinvent traditional sticky notes by making them digital and semi-decentralized. What started in manufacturing has now evolved into a modern platform that combines simplicity, security, and accessibility.

This site does not collect any user data, ensuring that your notes, ideas, and projects remain completely private.

To enhance privacy and data ownership, Sticky Card uses an XML-based export/import system. Only users with the correct XML file can open or read a workspace, keeping your projects secure. Read-only copies can be edited and saved as new workspaces.

All your notes and brainstorming sessions are automatically saved in your browser’s localStorage. You can also export your workspace as an XML file to back up, share, or transfer your data.
